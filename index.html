  <!-- <div class="info-title">What is the<br>New York School?</div> -->
  <div class="info-body">The New York School was an informal group of vanguard artists that were active in the 1950s and 1960s in New York City. Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock were at the center of the New York School and are just some of the artists that helped define New York City as the center of the art world. Their work introduced bold new innovations in form and content reflected a desire to embrace self expression and spontaneity. Explore the locations that were home to New York School to learn how the movement unfolded in New York City.<sup>1</sup></div>

  <div class="subhead">Castelli Gallery,<br>8 East 77th Street</div>
  <div class="body-copy">Leo Castelli was one of the earliest proponents of the New York School. Castelli, and his wife, were two of the three non-artist members of The Club. Castelli worked closely with the artists and was involved in organizing the famous Ninth Street Show in 1951, which was one of the first shows to display Abstract Expressionist works. Before opening his gallery in 1957, Castelli worked closely with gallerist Sidney Janis who was also an early supporter of the New York School. The Castelli Gallery opened down the street from the Sidney Janis Gallery and became one of the most prominent galleries in the world. The gallery showcased Abstract Expressionists, such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and others. The gallery remains open today in its original location and often exhibits work from its past.

  <div class="subhead">Rothko Studio,<br>157 East 69th Street</div>
  <div class="body-copy">Mark Rothko moved to New York City in the 1920s and quickly found himself immersed in the vast artistic community in the city, including gallery exhibitions with modernist works and museums both of which proved to be invaluable resources for his career. It was in New York City that Rothko had his first solo show and gained the recognition of many of the city’s art critics. Mayn years later, after moving in and out of the city, Rothko returned to New York and met with art dealer, Peggy Guggenheim. In 1945, Rothko displayed 15 of his works at Guggenheim’s noted Art of This Century Gallery. While this exhibit received negative feedback from critics, Rothko was inspired to move towards more of an abstracted style and created the works he’s known for today.</div>

  <div class="subhead">Betty Parsons Gallery,<br>15 West 57th Street</div>
  <div class="body-copy">Betty Parsons was an early advocate of The New York School and rarely turned these artists away from exhibiting work at her gallery. The gallery displayed the works of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt and others, long before they were household names. The gallery was one of the firsts to give the Abstract Expressionists their first large-scale exposure, especially after Guggenheim’s Art of This Century Gallery closed in 1947. Betty Parsons went on to promote the works of many gay artists in the years to come, such as Ellsworth Kelly and Robert Rauschenberg. After the passing of Parsons in 1982, the gallery continued to operate for just a few more years before closing. While Parsons is most known for her work as a gallerist, she was an artist herself and closed her gallery each summer to focus on her own work.</div>

  <div class="body-copy">Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of This Century Gallery opened in 1942 and played a critical role in launching the careers of many of the artists involved in The New York School. The gallery was opened for five years and was the first to exhibit the works of the Abstract Expressionists, most notably, Jackson Pollock. The gallery was almost like Guggenheim’s laboratory for exhibiting the most avant-garde works of the time and the gallery was set up in a way that encouraged viewers to interact with the artworks instead of just observing the art. The Art of This Century Gallery displayed the works of both American and European artists, often at the same time, which helped underline the importance of American art during a time when European art reigned supreme. Guggenheim’s willingness to promote young American artists helped instill a sense of confidence in the New York art scene.</div>

After becoming one of the most respected galleries in the city, Janis, along with his wife Harriet, went on the exhibit many of the artists involved in the New York School and give them their first solo shows. In 1952, Janis gave Jackson Pollock his first of three solo shows at the gallery and later put on its most famous exhibition entitled The New Realists. Around this time, Sidney Janis worked with gallerist, Leo Castelli, before he opened up his own gallery down the street. The gallery closed in 1999.</div>

  <div class="body-copy">Founded in 1929, The Museum of Modern Art in midtown Manhattan was the first museum devoted to the modern era. Today MoMA’s rich and varied collection offers a panoramic overview of modern and contemporary art, from the innovative European painting and sculpture of the 1880s to today's film, design, and performance art. From an initial gift of eight prints and one drawing, the collection has grown to include over 150,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, architectural models and drawings, and design objects; approximately 22,000 films and four million film stills; and, in its Library and Archives, over 300,000 books, artist books, and periodicals, and extensive individual files on more than 70,000 artists. Collection highlights include Claude Monet’s Water Lilies, Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night, and Pablo Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, along with more recent works by Andy Warhol, Elizabeth Murray, Cindy Sherman, and many others.</div>

  <div class="subhead">De Kooning Studio,<br>156 West 22nd Street</div>
  <div class="body-copy">A first-generation Abstract Expressionist, <u>Willem de Kooning</u> is one of the most important artists of the 20th century. In 1950s New York, when painters like Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline were moving away from representational imagery toward pure abstraction, de Kooning maintained a commitment to the figurative tradition, developing a signature style that fused vivid color and aggressive paint handling with deconstructed images of the female form—a then-controversial body of works that has become known as his “Women” paintings. “Flesh was the reason oil paint was invented,” he famously said. Influenced by Arshile Gorky and Pablo Picasso, de Kooning was often thought to have blended Cubism, Expressionism, and Surrealism in his signature style, paving the way for generations of gestural figurative painters like Cecily Brown. Following his “Women” series, de Kooning pursued non-objective lyrical abstraction until his death in 1997.</div>

  <div class="body-copy">Shortly after relocating to New York City, in 1935 Pollock settled into a Greenwich Village apartment at 46 East 8th Street with his Brother Sande, with whom he would live until 1942 when his love Lee Krasner moved in. This floor-through studio, located between Greene and Mercer Streets, was only $35/month.  Unfortunately, the building Pollock lived in has since been demolished and replaced. In 1931, Jackson Pollock, in need of money for food and rent, decided to set up his artwork on the sidewalk near Washington Square Park (this would become known as the Washington Square Outdoor Art Exhibit).  Willem de Kooning soon joined him.  This public display attracted the attention of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, founder of the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Alfred H. Barr Jr, Director at MoMa.  82 years later and this arts exhibit is still going strong.</div>

  <div class="subhead">Studio 35,<br>52 West 8th Street</div>
  <div class="body-copy">Hans Hofmann left not only a body of groundbreaking paintings, but also a legacy of students who became great Abstract Expressionist artists. Heather James Fine Art has opened The Hans Hofmann School, an exhibition featuring paintings by four of its namesake’s students: Michael Loew, Michael Goldberg, and John Little, and Michael Corrine West. The exhibition continues through June 30. The German-born artist was as prolific a teacher as he was a studio artist. He taught briefly at University of California, Berkeley; Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles; and the Art Students League of New York before starting the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Art in New York and Provincetown. The influential critic Clement Greenberg opined that Hofmann was “in all probability the most important art teacher of our time.” However, the artist closed the school in 1956 to focus on his own painting at the height of Abstract Expressionism. Hofmann, who was a generation older than his Ab Ex contemporaries, was 64 when Art of This Century in New York gave him his first solo exhibition in 1944.</div>
